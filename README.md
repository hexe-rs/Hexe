    A pure Rust chess engine

This project is split into two crates

- `hexe`: The chess engine itself.

- `hexe_core`: The chess engine's building blocks. This crate may be used by
other chess programs for ease of code reuse.

"Hexe" is German for witch. It denotes the use of magic bitboards within this
project.

It also refers to Clarke's Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."

Also, if she weighs the same as a duck... she's made of wood. And therefore...
