    A pure <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> chess engine
</p>

This project is split into two crates

- `hexe`: The chess engine itself.

- `hexe_core`: The chess engine's building blocks. This crate may be used by
other chess programs for ease of code reuse.

## Why Hexe?

"Hexe" is German for witch. It denotes the use of magic bitboards within this
project.

It also refers to Clarke's Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."

Also, if she weighs the same as a duck... she's made of wood. And therefore...
